# Facial Expression Recognition

## Introduction
For this problem I used the Toronto Faces Dataset, where the task was to classify images of faces based on their expression. Additionally, I was given access to 2925 labeled images for training and validation. The goal was to write a program that would achieve the highest accuracy on an unseen test set. In addition to the 2925 labeled data, I was provided with 98,058 unlabeled images that you used with to pretrain the CNN (details below). Achieved 9th or 98 entries https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/csc411f15-facial-expression-prediction.
